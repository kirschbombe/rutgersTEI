THE RAVEN.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“'Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                                                              Only this, and nothing more.”
 
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak Decebmer,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore1—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                                                              Nameless here for evermore.
 
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
“'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
                                                              This it is, and nothing more.”

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
                                                              Darkness there, and nothing more.
 
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”
                                                              Merely this, and nothing more.
 
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.
“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
                                                              'Tis the wind and nothing more!”
 
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; 
Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
                                                              Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!”
                                                              Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                                              With such name as “Nevermore.”
 
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
                                                              Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
 
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                                                              Of `Never—nevermore,' ”

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
                                                              She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
                                                              Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”
 
“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
                                                              Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”

 “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
                                                              Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”
 
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                                              Shall be lifted—nevermore!


THE ANGEL OF THE ODD.
AN EXTRAVAGANZA.

   It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an unusually
hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important
item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender,
and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which
were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit,
and liqueur. In the morning I had been reading Glover's Leonidas,
Wilkies Epigoniad, Lamartine's Pilgrimage, Barlow's Columbiad,
Tuckermann's Sicily, and Griswold's Curiosities; I am willing to confess,
therefore, that I now felt a little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself by aid of
frequent Lafitte2, and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in
despair. Having carefully perused the column of "houses to let," and the column
of "dogs lost," and then the two columns of "wives and apprentices runaway," I
attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from
beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of
its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no
more satisfactory result. I was about throwing away, in disgust,

“This folio of four pages, happy work,
Which not even poets criticise,”

when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows:
   "The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper mentions
the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was playing at 'puff the dart,'
which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a
target through a tin tube. He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube,
and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the
needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him."
   Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why. "This
thing," I exclaimed, "is a contemptible falsehood-a poor hoax-the lees of the
invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner-of some wretched concoctor of
accidents in Cocaigne. These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of the
age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities-of odd
accidents, as they term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine," I added,
in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose), "to
a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems evident at
once that the marvelous increase of late in these 'odd accidents' is by far the
oddest accident of all. For my own part, I intend to believe nothing
henceforward that has anything of the 'singular' about it.
   "Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!" 3 replied one of the most
remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears-such
as man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk-but, upon second
thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds
from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have
concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words. I am by
no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had
sipped served to embolden me a little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but
merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully
around the room for the intruder. I could not, however, perceive any one at all.
   "Humph!" resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, "you mus pe so dronk
as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your zide."
   Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there,
sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although
not altogether indescribable. His body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or
something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian air. In its nether
extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of
legs. For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably
long bottles, with the necks outward for hands. All the head that I saw the
monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large
snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen (with a funnel on its
top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the
puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed
puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was
emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for
intelligible talk.
   "I zay," said he, "you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me zit
ere; and I zay, doo, you most pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to dispelief vat iz
print in de print. 'Tiz de troof-dat it iz-eberry vord ob it."
   "Who are you, pray?" said I, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled;
"how did you get here? and what is it you are talking about?"
   "Az vor ow I com'd ere," replied the figure, "dat iz none of your pizzness; and
as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vot I tink proper; and as vor who
I be, vy dat is de very ting I com'd here for to let you zee for yourzelf."
   "You are a drunken vagabond," said I, "and I shall ring the bell and order my
footman to kick you into the street."
   "He! he! he!" said the fellow, "hu! hu! hu! dat you can't do."
   "Can't do!" said I, "what do you mean?-can't do what?"
   "Ring de pell," he replied, attempting a grin with his little villainous mouth.
   Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into execution;
but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and hitting me a
tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back
into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded; and,
for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the meantime, he continued his
talk.
   "You zee," said he, "it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know who I pe.
Look at me! zee! I am te ANGEL OV TE ODD!"
   "And odd enough, too," I ventured to reply; "but I was always under the
impression that an angel had wings."
   "Te wing!" he cried, highly incensed, "vat I pe do mit te wing? Mein Gott! do
you take me vor a shicken?"
   "No-oh, no!" I replied, much alarmed, "you are no chicken-certainly not."
   "Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I'll rap you again mid me vist. It iz
te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te imp ab te wing, und te
headteuffel ab te wing. Te angel ab NOT te wing, and I am te ANGEL OV TE
ODD."
   "And your business with me at present is-is-"
   "My pizzness!" ejaculated the thing, "vy vot a low bred puppy you mos pe vor
to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizzness!"
   This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so,
plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and hurled it
at the head of the intruder. Either he dodged, however, or my aim was
inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which
protected the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece. As for the Angel, he
evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps
upon the forehead as before. These reduced me at once to submission, and I am
almost ashamed to confess that, either through pain or vexation, there came a
few tears into my eyes.
   "Mein Gott!" said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my
distress; "mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronck or ferry sorry. You mos not
trink it so strong-you mos put de water in te wine. Here, trink dis, like a goot
veller, und don't gry now-don't!"  […]

SCENES FROM “POLITIAN;”  
AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.
 
I.
ROME.—A Hall in a Palace. Alessandra and Castiglione.
 
Alessandra.
Thou art sad, Castiglione.
 
Castiglione.
Sad!—not I.
Oh, I'm the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!
 
Aless.
Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
Thy happiness!—what ails thee, cousin of mine?
Why didst thou sigh so deeply?
 
Cas.
Did I sigh?
I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
A silly—a most silly fashion I have
When I am very happy. Did I sigh? (sighing.)
 
Aless.
Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these
Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—
Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away
The constitution as late hours and wine.
 
Cas. (musing.)
Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—not even deep sorrow—
Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
I will amend.
 
Aless.
Do it! I would have thee drop
Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born—
Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio's heir
And Alessandra's husband.
 
Cas.
I will drop them.
 
Aless.
Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more
To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain
For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends
Upon appearances.
 
Cas.
I'll see to it.
 
Aless.
Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,
To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest
In dignity.

Cas.
Much, much, oh much I want
In proper dignity.
 
Aless. (haughtily.)
Thou mockest me, sir!
 
Cas. (abstractedly.)
Sweet, gentle Lalage!

Aless.
Heard I aright?
I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage!
Sir Count! (places her hand on his shoulder)
What art thou dreaming? he's not well!
What ails thee, sir?
 
Cas. (starting.)
Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!
I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—
Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!

Enter Di Broglio.

Di Broglio.
My son, I've news for thee!—hey?—what's the
                    matter? (observing Alessandra.)
I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
I've news for you both. Politian is expected
Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!
We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit
To the imperial city.
 
         NOTES.
1"Lenore" is also the title character of another Poe poem published in 1843, two
years before "The Raven”.
2Château Lafite, one of the world's most sought-after red wines, is mentioned in
several Poe short stories.
3Poe apparently invented the strange dialect spoken by the angel in the story.
