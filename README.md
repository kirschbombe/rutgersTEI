# Digital Scholarly Editing with TEI
An introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative for the Nick Virgilio Archives project, Rutgers Digital Studies Center.

This repository contains the slidedeck, exercises, and resources for the _Digital Scholarly Editing with TEI_ workshop, January 29, 2016 at Rutgers-Camden.

All content created by Dawn Childress, except for the Edgar Allen Poe exercises which have been adapted and transformed over time from Christine Ruotolo's excellent intro to TEI at the _Digital Humanities in Theory and Practice: Tools and Methods for Librarians_ workshop (ALA 2012).
