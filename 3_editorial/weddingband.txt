Better the woman loves more than the man;
No woman wants to feel too sure of her man.


	wedding band


No woman want


No woman would feel to sure of her man


No woman would feel too sure of her man,
 hat obliges her to wear her wedding band.



 o woman would feel too sure of her man
 hose finger would swell from the wedding band.

 No woman would feel to sure of her man;
 Her finger would sweell

 No woman would feel to sure of her man;
 Her finger would swell from the wedding band.

 he more a woman feels sure of a man:
 he more her finger swells from the wedding band.

Better the woman loves more than the man,
Or her finger swells in  wedding band.

No woman would be
No woman would feel too sure of her man,
And always reminded of her wedding band.
